## Note: 
This is also used as a little test example for people learning kubernetes, there are multiple "Broken Instances" that if you deploy something will go wrong, it is up to you to figure out the problem. You can compare things to working instances to see it working. This of course does not troubleshoot nodes, etcd, or kubeadm configuration. Network policies are written for Calico.
